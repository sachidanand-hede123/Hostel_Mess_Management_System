## Hostel Mess Management System

### 📌 Overview
The *Hostel Mess Management System* is an innovative, token-based meal management platform designed to reduce food wastage and improve efficiency in hostel mess operations. The system allows students to generate meal tokens via a web-based interface, which is then converted into a QR code for verification at the mess counter. Monthly billing is generated based on the meals consumed, ensuring cost savings for students. Additionally, the system provides a *room delivery option* for sick students.

### 🚀 Features

#### 💳 Automated Billing System
- Monthly bills are automatically generated based on the number of meals availed.
